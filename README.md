# EuropeanBeerStar2025

A quick-and-dirty analysis of the results of the European Beer Star 2025, based on their published results.

The CSV file is a version of their published PDF table, where some additional translations to English are done. Also, I added a column for "Style Origin", as explained in both the notebook, and the corresponding [blog post](https://tasteofcraftbeer.wordpress.com/2025/09/20/european-beer-star-2025-medal-winners-and-insights/).
